when !pfa is typed this script gets activated

>[!important] scripts
>```
>:*c:!pfa::
>{
>   SendText "Sir/Mam,`n    Please find attached the [document/report/file name] for your reference. Kindly let me know if you have any questions or need further information. "
>}
>```

" * " = makes the script executes as soons as the letters are typed
" c " = makes the script case sensitive so !PFA is typed it will not be executed
